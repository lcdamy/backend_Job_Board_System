# Unit Testing Setup Complete

## Overview
I've set up a comprehensive unit testing framework for your backend Job Board System using Jest and TypeScript. Here's what has been implemented:

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- TypeScript support with ts-jest preset
- Test environment setup for Node.js
- Test file patterns and coverage configuration
- Module path mapping for clean imports

### 2. Test Setup (`__tests__/setup.ts`)
- Global test configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Logging configuration for tests

### 3. Test Helper (`__tests__/helpers/testHelper.ts`)
- Database setup and teardown utilities
- Mock data generators for User, Job, and Application
- Database cleaning functions
- Utility functions for test operations

### 4. Test Suites Implemented ✅

#### User Model Tests (`__tests__/unit/models/user.test.ts`)
**Status: ✅ Complete (6/6 passing)** - Tests for:
- User creation with validation
- User retrieval by email and ID
- User updates and modifications
- User deletion and cleanup
- Getting all users with pagination
- Email uniqueness validation

#### Job Model Tests (`__tests__/unit/models/job.test.ts`)
**Status: ✅ Complete (7/7 passing)** - Tests for:
- Job creation with all required fields
- Job retrieval by ID
- Job updates and field modifications
- Job deletion and cleanup
- Job search by title, company, location
- Getting all jobs with pagination
- Job-user relationship validation

#### Application Model Tests (`__tests__/unit/models/application.test.ts`)
**Status: ✅ Complete (9/9 passing)** - Tests for:
- Application creation with job and user references
- Application retrieval by ID
- Application updates and status changes
- Application deletion and cleanup
- Finding applications by job ID
- Finding applications by user ID

- Getting all audit logs with pagination
- Proper timestamp and metadata handling
- Request tracking functionality

## Issues Resolved ✅

### ✅ 1. Database Configuration
**Problem**: SQLite couldn't open database files in CI environment
**Solution**: 
- Implemented in-memory database (`:memory:`) for CI
- File-based database for local development
- Proper database path resolution across platforms

### ✅ 2. Test Isolation
**Problem**: Tests interfering with each other due to shared database state
**Solution**: 
- Added `beforeEach()` cleanup in all test files
- Improved `TestHelper.cleanDatabase()` with proper async handling
- Sequential test execution to prevent race conditions

### ✅ 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
**Problem**: GitHub Actions failing with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` errors
**Solution**:
- Updated pipeline configuration for proper environment setup
- Added Node.js 18 with dependency caching
- Environment variables properly configured for in-memory database
- Coverage reporting integrated and functional

### ✅ 4. TypeScript Configuration
**Problem**: Missing type definitions and incorrect module resolution
**Solution**:
- Fixed `tsconfig.json` configuration
- Added missing `@types/*` packages
- Corrected Jest module name mapping

## Current Test Results ✅
**All Model Tests: 27/27 passing (100% success rate)**
- ✅ User Model: 6/6 tests passing
- ✅ Job Model: 7/7 tests passing  
- ✅ Application Model: 9/9 tests passing
- ✅ AuditLog Model: 5/5 tests passing

## Next Steps to Expand Testing Coverage 🚀

### 🎯 Priority 1: Service Layer Tests (Target: 80% coverage)

- `__tests__/unit/services/applicationService.test.ts` - Application processing and file handling
- `__tests__/unit/services/auditService.test.ts` - Audit logging and tracking functionality

**Expected Tests Per Service**: 8-12 tests covering CRUD operations, business logic, error handling

### 🎯 Priority 2: Controller Tests (Target: 70% coverage)  
**Impact**: API endpoint validation - Currently 0% coverage
**Files to create**:
- `__tests__/unit/controllers/authController.test.ts` - Login, register, password reset endpoints
- `__tests__/unit/controllers/jobController.test.ts` - Job CRUD and search endpoints
- `__tests__/unit/controllers/applicationController.test.ts` - Application management endpoints
- `__tests__/unit/controllers/auditController.test.ts` - Audit log retrieval endpoints

**Expected Tests Per Controller**: 10-15 tests covering all HTTP methods, validation, error responses
